(the term `day mode' is also (but less frequently) used,meaning you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to 6).) the act ofaltering one's cycle is called `changing phase'; `phase shifting' hasalso been recently reported from caltech. 2. `change phase the hardway': to stay awake for a very long time in order to get into adifferent phase. 3. `change phase the easy way': to stay asleep, etc.however, some claim that either staying awake longer or sleepinglonger is easy, and that it is shortening your day or night that isreally hard (see [10294]wrap around). the `jet lag' that afflictstravelers who cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to twodistinct causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain ofchanging phase. hackers who suddenly find that they must change phasedrastically in a short period of time, particularly the hard way,experience something very like jet lag without traveling._________________________________________________________________node:phase of the moon, next:[10295]phase-wrapping,previous:[10296]phase, up:[10297]= p =phase of the moon n.used humorously as a random parameter on which something is said todepend. sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent, orthat reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has beenable to determine. "this feature depends on having the channel open inmumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon."see also [10298]heisenbug.true story: once upon a time there was a program bug that really diddepend on the phase of the moon. there was a little subroutine thathad traditionally been used in various programs at mit to calculate anapproximation to the moon's true phase. gls incorporated this routineinto a lisp program that, when it wrote out a file, would print atimestamp line almost 80 characters long. very occasionally the firstline of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the nextline, and when the file was later read back in the program would[10299]barf. the length of the first line depended on both the precisedate and time and the length of the phase specification when thetimestamp was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the phaseof the moon!the first paper edition of the jargon file (steele-1983) included anexample of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but thetypesetter `corrected' it. this has since been described as thephase-of-the-moon-bug bug.however, beware of assumptions. a few years ago, engineers of cern(european center for nuclear research) were baffled by some errors inexperiments conducted with the lep particle accelerator. as theformidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavilyprocessed by computers before being seen by humans, many peoplesuggested the software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon.a few desperate engineers discovered the truth; the error turned outto be the result of a tiny change in the geometry of the 27kmcircumference ring, physically caused by the deformation of the earthby the passage of the moon! this story has entered physics folklore asa newtonian vengeance on particle physics and as an example of therelevance of the simplest and oldest physical laws to the most modernscience._________________________________________________________________node:phase-wrapping, next:[10300]phb, previous:[10301]phase of themoon, up:[10302]= p =phase-wrapping n.[mit] syn.
